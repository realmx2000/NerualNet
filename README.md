# NeuralNet
Python implementation of a Neural Network API
This project was motivated by an assignment from Stanford's CS229 (Machine Learning) course, where we implemented a simple one layer neural network with sigmoid activations and softmax cross entropy loss to classify the MNIST dataset. The code used for that assignment can be found at http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps4/q1.
The program is a high level neural network API which currently supports both ReLU and sigmoid activations as well as softmax cross entropy and Weston-Watkins SVM/hinge loss for arbitrary network architectures (More to come). A sample program which uses the API to classify the MNIST dataset is included in MNIST_test.py.
